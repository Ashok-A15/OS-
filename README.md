7 a) Write a program to simulate grep command using system calls 
 
b) Write a program to generate and print Fibonacci series with the 
following requirements: 

   - Parent program should create a child and distribute the task of generating Fibonacci no to its child.

   - The code for generating Fibonacci series should reside in different program.

   - Child should write the generated Fibonacci series to a shared memory.
    
   - Parent process has to print by retrieving the Fibonacci series from theshared memory.
